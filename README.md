Bartok
======

A card game in which players may modify rules when they win

Assuming you have Stack, The following commands should get it running:
```
git clone https://github.com/penteract/Bartok.git
cd Bartok
./serve ```

(`serve` just does `stack build && stack exec server`)

You play a game of Bartok (initially similar to Uno) and when your hand is empty, you may submit code that modifies the rules.
